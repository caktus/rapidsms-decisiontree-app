Simple Tree Example
===================================

Below is the setup for an example survey which asks three basic questions to a user.
There are no branches and all responses allow for free text.


Creating Questions
------------------------------------

We will create the three questions via the admin interface with the following data::

    # Questions
    pk: 1
    text: What is your name?

    pk: 2
    text: What is your quest?

    pk: 3
    text: What is your favorite color?

.. note::
    
    The pks are listed for future reference but these would be auto generated by
    the database.


Creating Answers
------------------------------------

Next we will create an allowable answer in the admin. These questions don't require 
exact matches so we will just accept any text::

    # Answers
    pk: 1
    name: Free Text
    type: Regular Expression
    answer: .*

.. note::

    This regular expression will match anything. You may need to make this express less
    allowing depending on your needs.


Associating Questions and Answers
------------------------------------

Questions and answers are associated via tree states and transistions. Since we don't
have any branches the tree states and questions will be tied in a one to one fashion::

    # Tree States
    pk: 1
    question: 1

    pk: 2
    question: 2

    pk: 3
    question: 3

Within a tree state you can also optionally specify the number of allowable retries but
these have been excluded for simplicity.

Transistions determine how users are moved through the tree based on their answers. Here
we will allow any text for each question and simply move the user on to the next question::

    # Transistions
    pk: 1
    current state: 1
    answer: 1
    next state: 2

    pk: 2
    current state: 2
    answer: 1
    next state: 3

    pk: 3
    current state: 3
    answer: 1
    next state: null

Transistions can also be tagged and notifications can be sent when those tags are triggered. For
instance you may create a new answer which is for the text 'blue' and have a new transition
which handles the case when the user had the favorite color blue. Again this has been excluded
for simplicity.


The Survey Tree
------------------------------------

At this point the tree structure is in place to ask the series of questions but we
need a way to start the survey. Again in the admin we would create a Tree with a trigger
keyword which asks the user the first question::

    # Tree
    pk: 1
    trigger: #test
    root state: 1
    completion text: Go on. Off you go.

Now when an incoming SMS matches the trigger text ``#test`` we will respond with the question
from state one "What is your name?". They will proceed on with each question and when
finished we will respond "Go on. Off you go." This completion text is optional.

At this point we have a simple yet functioning linear survey tree. Continuing reading to 
see how we can add branches to this series of questions.
